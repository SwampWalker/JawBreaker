1. Download the zero temperature and zero proton fraction tables from Shen's
    website: http://user.numazu-ct.ac.jp/~sumi/eos/ (hyperons or otherwise)
2. Merge these files with mergeT0YP0.py
3. Add leptons to this file with an executable built with the main in 
    ShenZeroTemperature.java this will add hyperon columns if they weren't
    there already and an electron chemical potential  (units MeV).
4. Take the logarithm of this final equation of state using LogShenT0.java
5. Find beta equilibrium using ShenZeroTemperatureBetaEquilibrium
6. Add ShearModulus.
