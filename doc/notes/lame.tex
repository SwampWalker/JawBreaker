\section{Elastic constants: the Lam\'e coefficients}
In this section we consider the Lam\'e coefficients $q$ and $r_l$. These are related to some basic thermodynamic quantities in a manner specified earlier. The coefficient $r_l$ is perhaps the easiest relation
\begin{equation}
r_l \equiv 
\label{eq:q_lame}
\end{equation}
