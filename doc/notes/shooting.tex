\section{Finding the strained neutron star solutions: shooting}

A nice method in one dimension is the shooting method. A reference solution is evolved to give the background solution. The equation of state is modified via phase transition, and a new central pressure is selected as a guess. This solution is evolved until the conserved particle number interior to a given radius equals the conserved particle number in the interior of the reference solution. This gives the variables $m$, $r$ and $p^r{}_r$ at the boundary. The constituent equation for $p^r{}_r$ is inverted to compute $\xi'$, and this is used to compute $p^\theta{}_\theta$. If this equals $p^r{}_r$ then the shooting method has worked. Otherwise, a new guess pressure is selected. The comparison process is eased by noting that a solution is desired to the following,
\begin{equation}
p^r{}_r - p^\theta{}_\theta = n\tau_{RR}\xi'^2\left(1 - \frac{2m}{r}\right) - \frac{n\tau_{\Theta\Theta}}{r^2} = 0,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
p^r{}_r - p^\theta{}_\theta = \chi\left(P_I + \frac{\mu}{2}\left(\frac{1-\frac{2m}{r}}{1-\frac{2M}{\xi}}\xi'^2 - 1\right)\right)\frac{1-\frac{2m}{r}}{1-\frac{2M}{\xi}}\xi'^2 - \chi\left(P_I + \frac{\mu}{2} \left(\frac{\xi^2}{r^2} - 1\right) \right) \frac{\xi^2}{r^2} = 0.
\end{equation}
The solution has the structure
\begin{equation}
\chi\left(P_I + \frac{\mu}{2}(a - 1)\right)a = \chi\left(P_I + \frac{\mu}{2}(b - 1)\right)b.
\label{eq:rootStructure}
\end{equation}
The first solution to this polynomial is $a=b$; expanding and setting $\xi = R_c$
\begin{equation}
\frac{1-\frac{2m}{r_c}}{1-\frac{2M}{R_c}}\xi'^2 = \frac{R_c^2}{r_c^2}.
\label{eq:aEqualsb1}
\end{equation}
Rearranging this formula, a sufficient condition for the radial and tangential pressures to be equal is
\begin{equation}
\xi' = \sqrt{\frac{R_c^2}{r^2}\frac{1-\frac{2M}{R_c}}{1-\frac{2m}{r}}} = \sqrt{\frac{R_c^2-2M R_c}{r^2 - 2 m r}}.
\end{equation}


The shooting method is only convenient because one can use explicit time-stepping evolution algorithms, chiefly 4th order Runge-Kutta. In order to make use of this method, the constituent equation for the pressure \eqref{eq:functionalelastic} must be inverted using Newton-Raphson algorithm to compute $\xi'$. This can then be used to compute $p^\theta{}_\theta$ and the other derivatives.
